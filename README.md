# SNS_project_code
This project is based on python 3.10.0
BEFORE YOU START TO RUN THIS CODE, please change the path in sdncv3.py
YOU WILL FIND INCORRECT PATH IN LINE 3, 22, 42, 54, 55.
ONCE THE PATHES HAVE BEEN CHANGED, PLEASE RUN sdncv3.py on your terminal 
IF THERE ARE ANY ERROR, please make sure that numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, pandas and keras are downloaded
AFTER THIS sdncv3.py is working properly, you can find that terminal shows 'RUNNING on http://127.0.0.1:5062'
IF server is not responding, please try to change port
THE next step is to run client(1).py on terminal
FOR each time running client(1).py you can only chat with oracle and ask for weather prediction of only one city
IF you want to ask for prediction of another city, please run client(1).py and ask again
